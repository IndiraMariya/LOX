# Iterations
## Iteration #2:
## 2nd Iteration Code
 The code is meant to be used with the Arduino UNO board, servos, LCD display, and a joystick. The code from the second iterations is very similar to the code from the first iteration because we did not make major changes. The overall structure and function of the code are the same, the only difference is that there are some issues and errors that were in the previous code, and got fixed in this version of the code. This is mainly related to the way the timer worked because there were some issues with getting the timer to stop at the right time and making sure that no delays affected the timer. 

## Box Design
In our second Iteration design, we had many improved features that were added to solve the issues that we had in the previous design. First, we included pieces that would hold the LCD, joystick and CP board in place, so they were not loose or falling out. This allowed for better control and use of the joystick, and LCD. We also added the space in the door for a charger, so the users could charge their phone while inside the box.
