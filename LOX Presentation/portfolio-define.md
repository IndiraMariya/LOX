## The Problem
Our users felt like they weren't motivated and that they had trouble exercising and studying. This is an issue because not getting enough exericse can lead to many negetive factors. According to an article from Time Magazine, " In a sample of about 3,000 U.S. adults, people who were meeting exercise guidelines before the pandemic reported an average 32% reduction in physical activity once social-distancing measures went into effect.‚Äù The article shows that getting enough exercise is not just a problem for our users, it is a problem for the majority of people during the pandemic. Not getting enough exercise may not seem like such an important issue but, it can increase risk of heart disease risk factors type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity, and more.(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ). Another problem that our users had was not being able to study and focus in school due to being distracted by technology. According to the US National Library of Health, "Internet services have seen rises in usage from 40 % to 100 %, compared to pre-lockdown levels". Part of the reson internet services have increased is because of online learning, but internet services have also increased because people get more distracted by technology.According to the Derek Bok Center, Harvard University, "80% of students agreed that using a mobile phone in class decreases their ability to pay attention. " My group's goal is to help our users find a solution for being unmotivated. 

Due to the pandemic, many students at LAHS are struggling to stay motivated, whether it's being focused in school, or staying active. During the interview with our users, they said they were less motivated to work on things and got easily distracted by technology. They also mentioned that they were not able to exercise as much as they wanted. We would like to explore ways to help these students solve the problem of being easily distracted and unmotivated to exercise, so that they can not only feel guilt-free, but also become more productive in school and healthier in general. During online school there are a lot of distractions like technology in your workspace that can hinder them from focusing on schoolwork. This causes our users to avert their attention to their devices, which makes them struggle on tasks in class. In addition, students may also lose focus and not give their best effort while working on homework, which is inefficient and takes a long time. Furthermore, our users used to get sufficient amounts of exercise with school and extracurricular activities, but now they feel trapped in the house and too unmotivated to get some fresh air on their own. This is important  to our users because they want to change these bad habits and become more productive to improve academically. Additionally, by exercising more they can become healthier and energized. How might we create a way for our users to stay more motivated in school, and to get exercise?

## Summary of Reasearch
Through our research, my partner and I looked into the issue of being unmotivated to do work and exercise. We learned that it is extremely important to get exercise often, so being unmotivated to exercise can be unhealthy. We also learned that students are very dependent on technology and electronics, so they often get distracted by their phones and don't do thier work. This was one problem that our users wanted us to solve as well, so we conducted a survey with extreme users to get more information and data. Our research showed that students looked at their phones every 15 mintutes, and this could lead them to get distracted for a few minutes each time. It might not sound like much itme, but it all adds up, and students waste a lot of their time.

## Additional Research Method
My partner and I chose to do an extreme interview for our additional research. We conducted our interview by asking two different people the same set of questions. One person was someone who was focused and organized overall, and the other person was the exact opposite. By asking each of the people the same question, we learned what they did differently and how one person was able to stay focused and why the other person became distracted easily. Through the interview, we learned that one cause for distraction is when the user decides to take a break from working but then get carried away, and doesn't return to working again. Also, our focused user said that they are able to finish all their work without getting distracted because they put all of their devices away before working and they try to finish as much work as they can. Using the data gathered from out research we can start creating concept sketches for our users.
